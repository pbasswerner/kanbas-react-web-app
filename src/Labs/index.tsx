// Components can import other components to aggregate the code snippets
// of the components into larger, more complex HTML content. Here the
// Labs component imports the Lab1 component as the first of a
// set of assignments that will be implemented in later assignments.
// The Lab1 function is invoked with the HTML syntax <Lab1/>
// which is replaced by HTML the function returns implemented in the
// Lab1 function
